# nosilverbullet.dev

A reference-first editorial field guide for software people.

Four sections:

- **Failure Modes** — named software-engineering failure patterns
- **Tech Decisions** — trade-off references for consequential engineering decisions
- **Red Flags** — early warning signals in code, teams, process, leadership, and AI usage
- **Engineering Playbook** — practical playbooks for recurring engineering situations

This repository holds both the canonical editorial content (`content/`) and the
static site implementation (`src/`). The site is **static-first by design** and
targets **Cloudflare Pages Free**. No backend, no database, no runtime API
dependency for page rendering.

See `docs/` for the product, schema, design, build, route, and deployment
contracts — those documents are the source of truth; this README is a runbook.

---

## Status

**Phase 1 — Technical scaffold.** Routes, loaders, schemas, validation, and
layout shells are wired. No final UI yet. Phase 2 (Failure Modes vertical
slice) has not started.

---

## Stack

- **Astro 5** in static output mode (`output: "static"`).
- **TypeScript strict**.
- **Zod** schemas for content validation.
- **Plain CSS** with design tokens (no Tailwind, no component library).
- **Node 20+** recommended.

## Commands

```bash
npm install           # install dependencies
npm run dev           # local dev server
npm run build         # produces static `dist/` — deployable to Cloudflare Pages
npm run preview       # preview the built output
npm run validate      # run content integrity checks without building
npm run typecheck     # astro check (TS + .astro)
```

## Routes

Implemented in Phase 1 (see `docs/route-map.md`):

```
/
/failure-modes
/failure-modes/[slug]
/tech-decisions
/tech-decisions/[slug]
/red-flags
/red-flags/[slug]
/engineering-playbook
/engineering-playbook/[slug]
```

All detail pages are statically generated at build time from local JSON slugs.
No runtime routing or backend.

## Content

- Content lives in `content/`, one canonical file per category (Engineering
  Playbook is split across five files by subcategory — see
  `docs/content-location.md`).
- Every entry has a stable `slug` which is its canonical route key.
- Cross-references between entries use slugs, not display titles.
- Page components never import JSON directly — they go through
  `@/lib/load` and `@/lib/resolve`.

### Adding an entry

1. Open the relevant category JSON under `content/`.
2. Add an entry at the end of the `entries` array, following the shape of
   existing entries (or the matching schema under `src/content/schemas/`).
3. Make sure the slug is unique across the entire site (kebab-case, lowercase,
   hyphen-separated — see `docs/content-schema.md`).
4. Ensure the subcategory (`category` / `family` / `layer`) matches one of the
   values declared in the file's top-level `category` block.
5. Run `npm run validate` and `npm run build` to verify.

## Content validation

Validation runs:

- automatically at build time (from every page via `ensureValidated()`)
- on demand via `npm run validate`

Checks performed:

- **Slug uniqueness** (globally, across all four categories) — fails build
- **Subcategory validity** — every entry's `category` / `family` / `layer`
  must be declared in its file's top-level subcategory list — fails build
- **Enum conformance** — severity / frequency / patternConfidence values are
  validated at parse time via Zod schemas
- **Cross-reference integrity** — every related-slug in fields like
  `relatedFailureModes`, `oftenLeadsTo`, `adjacentDecisions`, etc. must
  resolve to an existing entry somewhere on the site

### Strict mode for cross-references

Cross-reference integrity runs as a **warning** by default because the
current content is still being migrated. To make it fail the build:

```bash
NSB_STRICT_REFS=1 npm run build
NSB_STRICT_REFS=1 npm run validate
```

Flip this to the default once content is clean.

## Styling philosophy

See `docs/design-direction.md`. The scaffold sets up tokens only — not
final components. No Tailwind-startup defaults, no pill clusters, no
gradient cards. Category identity is expressed via a single CSS variable
(`--accent-current`) set by the layout, not via duplicated components.

## Deployment

Target: **Cloudflare Pages, Free plan**.

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In Cloudflare Pages, connect the repo.
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Output directory: `dist`
5. No Pages Functions required. No environment variables required.

The output is a plain static site and can also be served from any static
host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.) without changes.

## Schema drift notes

The schemas under `src/content/schemas/` match the **actual JSON content**,
not the idealised field names in `docs/content-schema.md` and the category
schema docs. Several divergences were catalogued during Phase 1 scaffolding.
See Phase 1 completion notes in the commit history, or the docstrings at
the top of each schema file. These will either be reconciled by migrating
content, or by updating docs — that decision is deferred.
